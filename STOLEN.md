# Stolen Publications

Some of the Lux-Life Technology Awards publications in this repository were once deleted by AI Global Media, making them difficult to access. This repository aims to keep them available for future reference, particularly for those who won awards and no longer have access to these important pieces of their history.

## Why These Publications Were Stolen
The deletion of these works from the original publisher after a set period deprived winners and industry professionals of their ability to preserve their accolades. This repository is a step toward making sure these important records are not lost forever.
